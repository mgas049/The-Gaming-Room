# The-Gaming-Room
software design template for CS-230


 Who was the client? The Gaming Room
 
 What type of software did they want you to design?
 Using Java, The Gaming Room wanted a to develop a multi-platform application called "Draw It or Lose It"
 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 
I think that I did better at the UML, but that is based purely on circumstances.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design documant made the code have a real life application, which was more educational than just writing the code. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would revisit the recommendations in greater detail.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? 
I tried to place myself in the clients position to understand what they needed, so that I could better help solve the problem.

Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Understanding the problem is the first step in coming up with a solution. 

How did you approach designing software? 
I was given valuable resources to better understand the designs of the code. it provided better insight into what we were making. 

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In the future, envisioning what the client wants will develop a more clear path to understanding what design patterns are applicable.
